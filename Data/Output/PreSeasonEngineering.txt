Performing tests on the car...
Starting software test on car
No software test can be performed on a aerodynamic component
No software test can be performed on a chassis
electronics failed the software test
Starting software test on engine
Software test failed, engine does not have enough horsepower to be competitive
Car wind tunnel test failed, a component failed the test, number of failed components : 2
Starting wind tunnel test on car
Starting wind tunnel test on aerodynamic component, saving state of component
Wind tunnel test passed, aerodynamic component restored to previous state
Saving state of chassis
Wind tunnel test passed, chassis restored to previous state
electronics not suitable to test in the wind tunnel
engine not suitable to test in the wind tunnel
Car wind tunnel test passed, no components failed
Testing complete
